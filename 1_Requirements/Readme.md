Need of Detailed Analysis of Assessment

To identify performance of individual student in assessments and teacher can also track that performance we need a report card so to make report  card you need to do detailed analysis of Pre-survey, Post-survey, Pre-test marks and post-test marks.
 
Introduction 

In this project we are doing analysis of Pre-survey, Post-survey, Pre-test marks and post-test marks.
And after that we will send this detailed analysis of assessment as a feedback to student on his/her given email. As a feedback student will get his/her marks, average marks of class, Top 5 performer and bottom 5 students marks. And teacher will also get these details but she will get performance of whole class like average marks of class, Top 5 performer and bottom 5 students marks. By using this feedback she can contact bottom 5 student whether they need help or not.

Feasibility Analysis: 

During this step of system development life cycle as we have considered different aspect associated with this project like whether is this project economically feasible to us or not whether this project is technically feasible or not, whether we have known to the technologies we are using or not that any risk are associated with this things can be considered and resolve accordingly or if there is a need of change in the strategy or plan. We have tried to find out the answers of following questions. 

•	What are the needs of the users of the system and how our system will fulfill those needs? 

•	What are the services provided to user by this system? 

•	How our system will impact the users? 

•	Whether our system is able to generate and send individual report card to student? 

Technical analysis :-

During this step we are tried to find out whether the project is technically feasible to us or not and whether we will be complete this project by using the discussed technologies or not. At this step we find out that we all ready to work on the technology and complete the project.

•	We use excel to store a data.

•	We use Vscode software for implementation of project.

•	We use some python libraries for data analysis. Some libraries are pandas, Numpy, 
Matplotlib, seaborn and etc.

4W's and 1'H
Who is the user of the system?
The program is used by the students and the faculty to review the students before and after the course started. How much have the student improved and how much difference is there from that student to the average class.

What is the product?
The program is a visual report of the marks received by the students and also the self rating before and after the module starts and sends the combined report to the teacher with all the average rating, top performer and the last 10 % of the class. The students will receive a individual report on how he or she have done and how is their report in comparison with the class average with the help of the spider chart. Both stakeholders will receive the update with the help of the triggered email.

When is the product used?
The program is used when you require a individual or group report between the students and the teacher and it will be automatically triggered to the respective emails.

Where can we use the product?
The product can be used in a corporate training where the employer can review the individual on the basis of ratings and scores received. 
How can we use the product?
•	The product can be used by the students to see where they stand in class in comparison to the average marks and the top performer marks
•	The product can be used by the teacher to see the group result of the class and the students who require more attention and the top performers.
