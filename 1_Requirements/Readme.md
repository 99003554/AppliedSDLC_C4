Need of Detailed Analysis of Assessment

To identify performance of individual student in assessments and teacher can also track that performance we need a report card so to make report  card you need to do detailed analysis of Pre-survey, Post-survey, Pre-test marks and post-test marks.
 
Introduction 

In this project we are doing analysis of Pre-survey, Post-survey, Pre-test marks and post-test marks.
And after that we will send this detailed analysis of assessment as a feedback to student on his/her given email. As a feedback student will get his/her marks, average marks of class, Top 5 performer and bottom 5 students marks. And teacher will also get these details but she will get performance of whole class like average marks of class, Top 5 performer and bottom 5 students marks. By using this feedback she can contact bottom 5 student whether they need help or not.

4W's and 1'H
Who is the user of the system?
The program is used by the students and the faculty to review the students before and after the course started. How much have the student improved and how much difference is there from that student to the average class.

What is the product?
The program is a visual report of the marks received by the students and also the self rating before and after the module starts and sends the combined report to the teacher with all the average rating, top performer and the last 10 % of the class. The students will receive a individual report on how he or she have done and how is their report in comparison with the class average with the help of the spider chart. Both stakeholders will receive the update with the help of the triggered email.

When is the product used?
The program is used when you require a individual or group report between the students and the teacher and it will be automatically triggered to the respective emails.

Where can we use the product?
The product can be used in a corporate training where the employer can review the individual on the basis of ratings and scores received. 
How can we use the product?
•	The product can be used by the students to see where they stand in class in comparison to the average marks and the top performer marks
•	The product can be used by the teacher to see the group result of the class and the students who require more attention and the top performers.
